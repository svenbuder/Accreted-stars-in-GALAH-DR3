\caption{Overview of sources selected as accreted. We list the normalised probability $p$ of sources to be selected chemically via the \textsc{xdgmm} of $\mathrm{[Na/Fe]}$ vs. $\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]}$ as well as those dynamically selected based on the suggestion by \citet{Feuillet2021} in the $L_Z$ vs. $\sqrt{J_R}$ plane. The selection criteria are explained in detail in Secs.~\ref{sec:xdgmm_selection} and \ref{sec:dynamical_selection}, respectively. Chemically selected stars, as selected for the analysis throughout this study with $p > 0.45$ are marked in bold.}
