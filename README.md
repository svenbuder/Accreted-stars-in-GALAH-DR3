# The GALAH Survey: Chemical tagging and chronochemodynamics of the accreted halo stars in the Milky Way

This paper uses data from GALAH+ DR3: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201102505B  
The data files used for this study can be downloaded here: https://cloud.datacentral.org.au/teamdata/GALAH/public/GALAH_DR3/  
The notebooks used to analyse the data and create figures can be found in the *figures/* directory and links to each notebook are part of each figure caption in the manuscript. 
Gaussian Mixture Models used to explore which combination of abundances is most promising can be found in *gmm_sampling/*.
Final extreme deconvolution Gaussian Mixture Models used for the final modelling can be found in *xdgmm/*.
